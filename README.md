# Nova (`novac`)

Nova is a programming language designed to bridge the gap between functional programming and C-like systems languages. 

## Vision

Nova aims to make Functional Programming (FP) more accessible to developers familiar with C-like syntax (Rust, Zig, C, C++, etc.). By combining the power of languages like OCaml and Haskell with the familiar structure of imperative languages, Nova provides a low-friction path to adopting functional paradigms.

## Key Features

- **Friendly Syntax:** Inspired by Rust, Zig, and C-family languages to ensure a shallow learning curve for most developers.
- **Functional Roots:** Deeply influenced by OCaml, bringing robust type systems and functional patterns to the forefront.
- **Memory Management:** A garbage-collected language that also provides optional explicit control over allocations, similar to Zig's manual allocation patterns.
- **Modern Tooling:** Built with OCaml and the Dune build system for high-performance compilation and developer productivity.

## Getting Started

To explore the language, check out the `examples/` directory:

- `basic-functions.nova`
- `complex-types.nova`
- `currying-functions.nova`

For technical instructions on how to build, run, and test the compiler, please refer to [GEMINI.md](./GEMINI.md).
